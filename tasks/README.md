## Creating a new user

Press the 'sign up' link at the bottom of the log in page. Enter a name and
email. A manager is not required. A user can enter any existing user as a
manager to permit a greater amount of flexibility. This field can be null, 
as not everyone will have a manager. After pressing submit, the user is 
automatically logged in and taken to their homepage.

## Logging in

Enter an email in the 'email' field and click 'log in'. The user is taken to
their homepage.

All tasks are listed on the homepage. Only tasks that are assigned to the
logged in user and their employees are editable.

their employees.

Users can click the 'new' button in the top right corner to create a new task.
After filling out all required fields, they are taken back to the homepage.
